## 🌟 Introduction

I am passionate about **Artificial Intelligence**. Working with data makes me feel like a data detective, finding patterns and using them to help the world grow. Currently, I'm working on training and fine-tuning large language models like **LLaMA**, **Falcon**, **Bloom**, etc., on custom data. I believe in balancing research and implementation. Accuracy is important, but so is designing and developing scalable models. I am actively learning about **Generative AI**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **MLOps**, and **AI System Architecture**.

## 💼 What I Do

### 🚀 Language Model Training and Deployment
- **Training and Fine-Tuning:** Pre-trained and fine-tuned large language models like **LLama**, **Falcon**, and **Bloom** on custom datasets for clients.
- **Deployment:** Deployed these models on client infrastructures, ensuring efficient inference and data privacy using quantization techniques to reduce memory footprints.

### 📚 Document Q&A Systems
- **Search Pipeline Update:** Upgraded an existing keyword-based search pipeline to an embedding-based search pipeline using transformer models and Elasticsearch.
- **System Development:** Led a team to develop a document Q&A system from scratch, deployed it using Kubernetes.

### 🎙️ Audio and Text Analysis
- **HR Systems:** Developed and deployed systems to help HR filter candidates with good communication skills using Kubernetes.

### 📝 JD-CV Comparison
- **Project Development:** Led a team to develop and deploy modules for a JD-CV comparison project.

### 💬 Chatbots and NLP Systems
- **Chatbot Development:** Developed and deployed chatbots using Bot Framework, Azure bot service, and rasa, including re-architecting systems for dynamic chat flow creation.
- **Resume Parsing:** Trained document layout and NER models to extract relevant data from resumes in a structured format.

### 🖥️ Computer Vision
- **Pipeline Enhancement:** Replaced an old OpenCV-based video processing pipeline with a deepstream-based pipeline.
- **Model Training:** Collected data, cleaned and preprocessed it, and trained models for object detection, classification, and tracking.

### 🎤 Speech-to-Text Systems
- **End-to-End Ownership:** Took ownership of the end-to-end speech-to-text process, transitioning from Kaldi to deepspeech for improved accuracy and efficiency.
